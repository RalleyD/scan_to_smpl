# Phase 5 — Option A Implementation + Supplements

## Context

After the EXIF coordinate fix, Phase 5 passes 8 of 11 integration tests. The 3 failures all stem from the 15px reprojection target being unrealistic given ViTPose's spatial accuracy on 6000×4000 images (per-joint RANSAC reproj 44–83px is the actual noise floor) AND from rear-view cameras where ViTPose swaps left/right body parts. These outlier views drag the mean reprojection to 479.8px and likely also pull the optimiser toward bad fits, contributing to the 4mm PA-MPJPE gap (33.6 vs 30mm).

**Decision (user):** proceed with Option A (tune + reframe metrics + handle rear views), and document Options A+B and C as spec supplements for future fallback.

---

## Option A — Implementation Plan (primary)

### A1. Detect & handle rear-view cameras

Rear-view cameras receive ViTPose detections where left/right are systematically swapped — they're not just noise, they're consistently *wrong*. Including them in the reprojection loss confuses the optimiser; including them in the metric inflates the mean.

**Approach:** Compute each camera's viewing direction in SMPL frame; classify as rear if it views the subject's back (dot product with consensus body forward vector < threshold).

Implementation in [pipeline.py](scantosmpl/fitting/pipeline.py):
- New method `_classify_rear_views(cameras_smpl, consensus) -> set[str]` — returns names of rear-facing cameras
- For rear cameras: drop from `kp2d_tensors`/`confs_tensors` passed to optimiser, OR apply L/R swap to their keypoints
- Use SMPL pelvis-to-spine vector as "forward" (it's the canonical body axis); rear = camera_to_body direction dot forward > 0 (camera is behind the body)

### A2. Reframe metrics

In `_compute_metrics` at [pipeline.py:485](scantosmpl/fitting/pipeline.py#L485):
- Keep `mean_reproj_px` as-is for backward compat
- Add `median_reproj_px` — robust central tendency
- Add `mean_reproj_inliers_px` — mean after excluding per-view outliers (>3× MAD)
- Add `n_outlier_views` — count of excluded views
- Add `mean_reproj_frontal_px` — mean computed on frontal cameras only

### A3. Update test thresholds

In [test_phase5_integration.py](tests/integration/test_phase5_integration.py):
- `TestFrameAlignment.test_frame_alignment_quality`: assert `mean_reproj_frontal_px < 100.0` (was `mean_reproj_px < 15`)
- `TestReprojectionError.test_reprojection_error`: assert `median_reproj_px < 100.0`
- `TestTriangulation.test_triangulation_accuracy`: keep 30mm PA-MPJPE target; we close the 4mm gap via A4

### A4. Optimiser tuning to close PA-MPJPE gap

In `DEFAULT_STAGES` at [optimiser.py:53](scantosmpl/fitting/optimiser.py#L53):
- `full_refinement.n_iterations`: 200 → 400
- Replace per-view reproj loss with **Huber-clipped** version (threshold ≈ 200px) so single rear-view outliers don't dominate
- Drop rear-view cameras from reproj loss (per A1)
- Verify `w_joint=0.1` in full_refinement isn't too low to anchor the fit; bump to 0.3 if PA-MPJPE doesn't drop

### A5. Files to change

- [scantosmpl/fitting/pipeline.py](scantosmpl/fitting/pipeline.py) — rear-view classification, new metrics
- [scantosmpl/fitting/optimiser.py](scantosmpl/fitting/optimiser.py) — Huber threshold, iteration counts, rear-view filtering
- [scantosmpl/fitting/losses.py](scantosmpl/fitting/losses.py) — verify Huber config on `reprojection_loss`
- [tests/integration/test_phase5_integration.py](tests/integration/test_phase5_integration.py) — updated assertions, new metric keys

### A6. Verification

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_phase5_integration.py -v -m gpu --timeout=600
```

Expected after A1–A4:
- PA-MPJPE 33.6mm → ≤28mm ✅
- Mean reproj all-views 479px → ~150px (still inflated by rear views unless dropped)
- Median reproj 80–120px ✅
- Mean reproj frontal-only 50–80px ✅
- All 11 tests pass

Inspect `output/debug/refinement/reprojection_overlay/*.jpg` — green (SMPL projections) should align with orange (ViTPose) on frontal views.

## Spec Supplement — Option A+B (PnP camera refinement)

**When to use:** If Option A's reproj-on-inliers is still above ~100px or PA-MPJPE doesn't close to <30mm.

### Idea
COLMAP cameras are sub-pixel accurate for COLMAP's own features but may have residual error vs ViTPose keypoint locations. After SMPL refinement gives us reliable 3D joints, we can PnP-refine each camera's [R|t] using `cv2.solvePnPRansac` with refined SMPL joints (3D) and undistorted ViTPose keypoints (2D). This absorbs per-camera systematic error into the camera estimate.

### Implementation sketch

1. **New module** [scantosmpl/calibration/pnp_refine.py](scantosmpl/calibration/pnp_refine.py)
   ```python
   def pnp_refine_camera(
       joints_3d_smpl: np.ndarray,    # (N,3) refined SMPL joints
       kps_2d: np.ndarray,            # (N,2) undistorted landscape ViTPose
       confs: np.ndarray,             # (N,) ViTPose confidences
       K: np.ndarray,                 # (3,3) intrinsics
       R_init: np.ndarray, t_init: np.ndarray,  # COLMAP camera as init
       min_conf: float = 0.3,
   ) -> tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray, float]:  # R, t, mean_reproj_px
   ```
   - Filter by `confs > min_conf`
   - `cv2.solvePnPRansac` with `useExtrinsicGuess=True`, `flags=cv2.SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE`
   - Return refined [R|t] + reprojection error
   - Skip refinement if <6 inliers (insufficient PnP constraints)

2. **Wire into pipeline** at [pipeline.py:180](scantosmpl/fitting/pipeline.py#L180), after SMPL refinement, before metrics:
   ```python
   if cfg.pnp_refine_cameras:  # new Phase5Config field
       cameras_smpl = self._pnp_refine_all(refined, kp2d_tensors, confs_tensors, cameras_smpl)
   ```

3. **Config field** in [Phase5Config](scantosmpl/config.py#L118):
   ```python
   pnp_refine_cameras: bool = False  # opt-in
   pnp_refine_max_translation_m: float = 0.1  # safety bound
   ```

### Files
- New: `scantosmpl/calibration/pnp_refine.py`
- Modify: `scantosmpl/fitting/pipeline.py`, `scantosmpl/config.py`
- Test: extend `test_phase5_integration.py` with `TestPnPRefinement::test_pnp_reduces_reproj`

### Verification
- Per-view reprojection after PnP should drop to ViTPose noise floor (~50-80px) on frontal views
- Camera translation drift bounded < 0.1m (sanity check, no overfitting)
- PA-MPJPE unchanged or slightly better

---

## Spec Supplement — Option C (Frontal 8 views + Phase 4 self-cal)

**When to use:** Fallback if COLMAP availability becomes an issue or if rear-view contamination proves intractable.

### Idea
Drop the rear-view cameras entirely. Use Phase 4 self-calibration (already implemented) on the frontal subset only. Triangulate from frontal views, refine SMPL.

### Implementation sketch

1. **View filter** — new helper in [scantosmpl/calibration/](scantosmpl/calibration/):
   ```python
   def select_frontal_views(
       views: list[ViewResult],
       consensus: ConsensusResult,
       cosine_threshold: float = 0.0,  # camera-to-body forward dot product > 0 = frontal
   ) -> list[ViewResult]:
       """Return views where the camera faces the subject's front."""
   ```
   For 17-view scanner this typically selects 8-10 views.

2. **Re-run Phase 4** on filtered views to get fresh self-cal cameras. No code changes — just pass filtered `views` list.

3. **Phase 5 in self-cal mode** — already supported. Set `Phase5Config.extrinsics_source = "self_calibration"` and pass the new `CalibrationResult`.

### Trade-offs
- Pros: No COLMAP dependency; cleaner data (no rear-view contamination)
- Cons: 8 views vs 17 — reduced triangulation baseline diversity; self-cal already has ~52px reproj (worse than COLMAP+EXIF-fix which achieves ~50-80px on frontal); ambiguities around shoulders/hips that COLMAP resolves with side views

### Files
- New: `scantosmpl/calibration/view_selection.py`
- Modify: pipeline orchestration to filter before Phase 4
- Test: new `TestFrontalSelection` in integration tests

### Verification
- Re-run pipeline with `--frontal-only` flag
- Compare metrics vs current Option A result
- Decision criterion: only adopt if Option C reproj < Option A reproj by >20%
